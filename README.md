# MSGA - Make Substrate Great Again

A inline-hook library, no shit.

Note: nested hooks are currently not supported.

> The cydia substrate is a great hook framework, unfortunately its latest version is closed source, and its older version does not support aarch64 platform.
> I tried other inline-hook framework to hook functions and it crashed my process like stupid shit, unbelievable.
> Updating the substrate source is too complicated, creating a new project might be much easier, so MSGA was born.
> Lets Make Substrate Great Again.
